# 3Dgame

i make a 3dgame with pure python and math running in terminal using raycasting method(kinda inspired by old Doom).

# How it works & features

i can't explain everything but , the game working by using ascii char to define shading and using fov and angles to calculate wall height , width and distance.

## features

  - it can run smooth.
  
  - a small minimap to indicate your place.
  
  - also you can customize the map just by modifying "#" in the code.

### extras

i do this because i want to add a game to my own os (you can check in repositories) , so i think and came out with this idea to make it using raycasting or just 
printing character , i am still working on it to transform it to c and working with the buffer and other things , but i found a lot of issue like the lag of the os
becasue of the super bad optimization , but of course i am gonna try my best to complete it .
